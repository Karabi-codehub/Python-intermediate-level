🔢 Problem: Command-line Calculator
We need to create a small calculator tool that works in the terminal (command line).
✅ What it should do:
    • It will ask the user to type something like:
add 5 7
    • The program will understand that the user wants to add 5 and 7, and return:
12
🧠 Hint Explanation:
We can use:
input().split()
This:
    • input() gets the user's full text (like "add 5 7").
    • .split() turns that into a list of words like:
['add', '5', '7']
Then we can check what the user wants to do using if, elif:
    • If they typed "add", we add the numbers.
    • If they typed "subtract", we subtract, and so on.
