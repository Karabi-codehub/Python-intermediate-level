💡 Problem Statement:
We want to build a password validator — a small program that checks if a password is strong and secure.
✅ A good (strong) password must:
    1. Be at least 8 characters long.
    2. Contain at least one uppercase letter. (like A, B, C, ...)
    3. Contain at least one lowercase letter. (like a, b, c, ...)
    4. Contain at least one digit. (like 1, 2, 3, ...)
    5. Contain at least one special character. (like @, #, !, etc.)
🧠 How to Solve?
We'll use Python to do this.
We can either:
    • Use manual checks (any() and string methods), OR
    • Use regular expressions (regex) — a pattern-matching method.
