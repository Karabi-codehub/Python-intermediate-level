✅ What is an Apache Log File?
An Apache log file stores information about every request made to a website. Each line in the log represents a request and usually starts with the IP address of the visitor.
Example line from Apache log:
192.168.1.1 - - [29/May/2025:10:15:32 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
Here, 192.168.1.1 is the IP address.
  Example
    • Imagine a guestbook where every visitor writes their name (IP).
    • You want to know who visited the most.
    • We’ll count how many times each “name” (IP) appears and find the top 3.
📝 Explanation of the  code:
    1. from collections import Counter
        ◦ Imports the Counter class, which helps count how many times each IP appears.
    2. ip_counter = Counter()
        ◦ Initializes a Counter object to store counts of each IP.
    3. with open(log_file_path, 'r') as file:
        ◦ Opens the log file for reading.
    4. for line in file:
        ◦ Loops through each line in the file.
    5. ip = line.split()[0]
        ◦ Assumes the IP address is the first element in each line of the log (standard Apache format).
    6. ip_counter[ip] += 1
        ◦ Increments the count for that IP.
    7. ip_counter.most_common(3)
        ◦ Retrieves the top 3 most common IPs with their counts.
    8. Prints the results.
