upgrade the calculator so it:

Works in a loop â€“ keeps running again and again.

Stops only when the user types exit.

Supports more operations like:

    â€¢ add
    â€¢ 
    â€¢ subtract
    â€¢ 
    â€¢ multiply
    â€¢ 
    â€¢ divide
    â€¢ 
    â€¢ power (e.g. 2 power 3 = 8)
    â€¢ 
    â€¢ mod (modulus: remainder)
    â€¢ 
    â€¢ max (finds the bigger number)
    â€¢ 
    â€¢ min (finds the smaller number)
      
ðŸ§  Easy Explanations:
    â€¢ while True: â†’ keeps the calculator running until we break the loop.
    â€¢ if user_input.lower() == "exit": â†’ stops the program when you type exit.
    â€¢ split() â†’ breaks your text into words like ['add', '5', '7'].
    â€¢ float() â†’ allows both whole numbers (5) and decimals (5.5).
    â€¢ try...except â†’ catches errors if you type something that's not a number.
    â€¢ max(a, b) â†’ gives the bigger number.
    â€¢ min(a, b) â†’ gives the smaller number.
